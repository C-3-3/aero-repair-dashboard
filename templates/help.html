<h2>🛠 Dashboard Help & User Guide</h2>

<p>This dashboard was built in-house to support Aero Repair Corp's Part 145 operations by improving visibility, accountability, and documentation across the facility.</p>

<h3>🔧 Available Tools</h3>
<ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
    <li><strong>🧰 Maintenance Tasks</strong>: Create, assign, and track internal jobs for facilities, tooling, or production support. Role-based permissions apply — technicians can view and complete, managers can create and delete.</li>
    <li><strong>✍️ Digital Sign-Off Log</strong>: Submit and view technician sign-offs for completed work. Each entry is timestamped and linked to the task or service performed.</li>
    <li><strong>🔍 Part Inspections</strong>: Document the condition of received parts, including packaging, paperwork, and general acceptance notes.</li>
    <li><strong>⏰ Expiry Tracker</strong>: Monitor important expiration dates like calibration, training, and regulatory documents. Alerts are triggered automatically for upcoming expirations.</li>
    <li><strong>📁 PDF Log</strong>: Review the history of automatically sorted incoming PDFs. Files are routed based on keywords found in their content and filed accordingly.</li>
</ul>
